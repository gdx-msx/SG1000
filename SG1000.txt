     SG-1000(II), FG-1000, SC-3000, Othello 
 Multivision & Mark III/Korean Gam*boy ROM Loader
  for MSX with Franky, Musical Memory Mapper or
             Playsoniq cartridge

                v0.96 by GDX
-------------------------------------------------

SG1000.COM allows you to play SG-1000 games on MSX. Franky, Musical Memory
Mapper or Playsoniq cartridge allows to get a perfect sound.
You will not get sound without one of these three cartridges.


How to install:

 In MSX-DOS1, copy SG1000.COM, SG1000.DAT and SG1000F.DAT on the same disk
 where there are your Roms.

 In MSX-DOS2 or Nextor, you can copy SG1000.COM in another folder or disk
 if the path is specified in the environment variable PATH.
 
 SG1000F.DAT is not necessary if you don't have a Franky cartridge.
 

Using:

 SG1000.COM is a MSX-DOS1/2 command. 
 Input the command and file name of the ROM in following order.

  >SG1000 RomName.ext

 /F option must be added if you use the Franky cartridge. Otherwise, you can
    rename SG1000F.DAT as SG1000.DAT to avoid specifying the option.

 /S option can be used to get the colors like the Sega Master System.
